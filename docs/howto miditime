-Midifile constructor(creating track): MIDITime(bpm,filepath.midi)
    ex. mymidi = MIDITime(120,'test.midi')

-Single note template: [time, pitch, velocity, duration]
    #offset = on with note will be played expressed as beats [0-max_int] the later note is played the track is longer
    #pitch = note name A4,C5 expressed as MIDI number [21-108]
    #velocity = volume [0-127]
    #length = expressed in beats [0-12]

-Creating list of notes:
    ex. mynotes = [
        [0, 60, 127, 3],
        [6, 80, 127, 3]
    ]
-Appending notes list to the track:
    mymidi.add_track(mynotes)
